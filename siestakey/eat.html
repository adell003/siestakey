            <div class="restaurant"> Ophelia's on the Bay
                <p class="mediumfoodabout">
                    When you visit Ophelia’s, one of the first things you’ll notice is our view. Our two glass walled
                    dining rooms and outside open air patio give you an unfettered, eye-level view of Little Sarasota
                    Bay. As you peruse our menu and enjoy one of our carefully chosen wines, you’ll watch tropical birds
                    fly among preserved mangrove islands, watch the water gently sway, and see dolphins, blue herons,
                    and other sea life pass by. We’re proud to offer natural splendor the way Florida should be: no
                    glitz, no glamour, just nature at its best.
