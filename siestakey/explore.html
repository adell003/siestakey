            <div class="fun"> Siesta Public Beach
                <p class="funabout">Enjoying its reputation as one of America’s Best Beaches, Siesta Beach is made famous
                    by its sugar-fine, quartz-white sand.  A short jaunt from the public beach is a village of outdoor
                    dining, coffee shops and shopping.  Turtle Beach sits beyond the sea grapes on the Key’s southern end
                    and is a popular site for launching kayaks. </p>

                <p class="mediumfunabout">
                    The Drum Circle, which meets every Sunday evening, year-round, on Siesta and Englewood Beaches begins
                    approximately one hour before sunset. I cannot conceive how it’s arranged or coordinated, and truly
                    don’t believe it is. I get the vibe that it’s one of those organic events that happens almost by
                    magic. Participants are there by choice, not obligation, and it’s the joy brought by the Circle that
                    draws spectators and artists alike back, on time, each and every week.
